1. REST API
2. Traffic Estimation
3. Choke point
4. Load balancing
5. Horizontal Scaling / Vertical Scaling
6. Distributed Database
7. How the internet works
8. UDP packet
9. Latency - response time (different types of latency) 

10. Client server model

11. OSI model
    Application
    Presentation
    Session
    Transport
    Network
    Data Link 
    Physical (Wire/Wireless)

12. How two process communicate with each other  in a computer?
  (Shared memory/ Message Passing / Common file sharing / Netwokring)

   Linux Kernel (IPC), Socket, API

NIC - Network interface card
MAC - Media Access Control

MAC is burned into NIC


13. How two process on different computers communicates? 
  -- Need a path for communicating

14. Data Transfer Rate (kbps)
     16 kbps means a transfer rate of 16*1024 bits per second

15. Bandwidth - 
16. Bandwidth vs data transfer rate
17. Port (https: 443  , http: 80)
    process to port is mapped one to one (Transport Layer)
18. Socket Programming 
	
	TCP port range : 
	ring buffer :
	-->all linux curnet buffers are aynchronous.

19 . Server timeout 
20. TCP Handshaking
		HTTP/HTTPS --> applicaion layer protocol
		TCP/UDP --> Transport layer protocol

21. Stateful vs Stateless 
22. Contrack

23. Operating system can be diviced into two space:
 User Space
 Kernel Space

24. NAT GateWay - Network Address Translation

25. Switch vs Router

    CIDR (classless interdomain routing)
    //Practical Networking (CCNA)

26. IP Pool
27. DHCP vs NAT
28. Rate Limiting
